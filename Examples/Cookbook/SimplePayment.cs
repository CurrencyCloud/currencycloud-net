                 *
                 * a. Regular payments: Made using the local bank network. Regular payments are normally received by beneficiary’s within
                 * five working days of the settlement date. This is a good choice for low-value, non-urgent transactions.
                 *
                 * b. Priority payments: Made using the SWIFT network. Payments can be made to over 212 countries, and 95% of payments
                 * arrive within one working day.
                 *
                 * You want to make a regular payment to a supplier based in Germany. You will pay the beneficiary in Euros. You have
                 * enough funds in your Euros balance already to make this payment, so there is no need to top-up your Euros balance
                 * beforehand.
                 *
                 * First, check what details are required to make a regular payment in Euros to a beneficiary with a bank account in
                 * Germany. To do that, call the Get Beneficiary Requirements endpoint.
